		<p class="aboutmeText margin">My education has been quite
			rewarding. As someone who is passionate about learning, I've found
			myself eager to get engaged in my courses at the University of Utah
			with a strong foundation from my previous education at Mass Academy
			of Math and Science. After closely collaborating with my peers during
			junior year, the 50 of us enrolled full-time in classes at Worcester
			Polytechnic Institute for our senior year. Below, you can take a look
			at my research for my science fair project, a write-up for a
			collaborative math modeling competition, and a gem from one of my
			first ECE labs.</p>

					starting in 2016 until I aged out in 2023. Now, I'm competing in
					the Collegiate competitions on the University of Utah Climbing
