		<h1 id="projects" class="portfolio-header"> C# & .NET MAUI Projects </h1>
		<h2> Agar.io Game Remake</h2>
		<p> Recreated the Agar.io game displayed through a GUI with the user handling server protocols and JSON serialization for
			communication between server/user, with an additional mini-map feature. This project had many moving parts between the game logic and GUI design, making it a valuable learning experience.</p>
		<h2> Chat Client</h2>
		<p> Built a client/server messaging program using TCP networking protocols with a functional GUI.</p>
		<h2> Spreadsheet</h2>
		<p> Designed a mock spreadsheet application with a user interface, supporting imports from files in XML and basic
			mathematical functions as well as cell relations.</p>

		<div class = "portfolio-blurbs">
		<h1 class="portfolio-header"> Python Projects</h1>
		<p> I have mainly used python for machine learning and data analysis, using PyTorch, NumPy, and Pandas libraries.</p>
		<h2> </h2>

		<div class = "portfolio-blurbs">
		<h1 class="portfolio-header"> Java Projects </h1>
		<h2> Integrated SQL Database Queries </h2>
		<p> Built relational tables with triggers in Oracle SQL and queried them through a Java connection.</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "portfolio-blurbs">
		<h1 class="portfolio-header"> Verilog Projects </h1>
		<h2> Metronome</h2>
		<p>Used the Basys 3 Board to simulate a metronome, using the buttons to change the time and lights to flash to the time.</p>
