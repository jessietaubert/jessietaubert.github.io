			<p> Languages: <br><br>
				C &emsp; C# &emsp; C++ (and Qt) &emsp; Java &emsp; SQL &emsp; Python &emsp; JavaScript (with d3, React Native, Node.js) &emsp; HTML &emsp; CSS &emsp;  R &emsp; Verilog &emsp; MATLAB &emsp; Dart </p>
			<p> Tools: <br><br>

			<p> <br> I consider myself to have a strong foundation in collaborative problem solving and communication from my work experience and education.
				 I enjoy computer science for the logic aspects and challenge of creating unique, efficient solutions to seemingly simple problems! I also love how there is always something to new learn.</p>
			<p><br> While exploring the computer science field, I have found myself diving into the niches of data science and machine learning, as well as electrical and computer engineering.</p>

			<h1 class="portfolio-header"> C++ & Qt Projects </h1>
			<h2> Color Mixing Game </h2>
			<p> Collaborated in a team to develop a color mixing game with three levels. Each level has three stages, with four swatches to match. There is a bit of an error tolerance based on the euclidean distance in color space, 
				as well as an API call to name each color in the cauldron. Box2D was used to add interactivity to the game.</p>

			<h2> Sprite Editor </h2>
			<p> Created a sprite editor using Qt. This invovled allowing a user to select different brush colors, brush sizes, canvas sizes, 
				as well as an animation preview with the ability to change the animation speed. The user is able to click on different frames, make new frames, and use the onion skin feature to reference other frames. The user can also save as a JSON file and load previous sprite projects in.</p>
			<h2> Simon Game </h2>
			<p> Recreated the Simon memory game using Qt. Involved timer structure and signal/slot architecture as well as game logic.</p>
			<h2> Wavy Text Generator </h2>
			<p> Simple wavy text generation using Haru library. </p>
		</div>

		<div class = "portfolio-blurbs">
			<h1 id="projects" class="portfolio-header"> C# & .NET MAUI Projects </h1>
			<h2> Agar.io Game Remake</h2>
			<p> Recreated the Agar.io game displayed through a GUI with the user handling server protocols and JSON serialization for
				communication between server/user, with an additional mini-map feature. This project had many moving parts between the game logic and GUI design, making it a valuable learning experience.</p>
			<h2> Chat Client</h2>
			<p> Built a client/server messaging program using TCP networking protocols with a functional GUI.</p>
			<h2> Spreadsheet</h2>
			<p> Designed a mock spreadsheet application with a user interface, supporting imports from files in XML and basic
				mathematical functions as well as cell relations.</p>
		</div>

		<div class = "portfolio-blurbs">
			<h1 class="portfolio-header"> Python Projects</h1>
			<p> I have mainly used python for machine learning and data analysis, using PyTorch, NumPy, and Pandas libraries.</p>
		</div>

			<h1 class="portfolio-header"> HTML, CSS, & JS Projects</h1>
			<h2> Utah Air Quality Index Visualization</h2>
			<p> Created a web page to display charts and data visualizations using D3 for the air quality index in Utah counties over time. The focus for this project was interactivity.</p>
			<p> View the web page here: <a href="https://dataviscourse2024.github.io/group-project-air-quality-visual-1/"> AQI Visualization </a> or watch the screen-cast below!</p>
			<video controls>
				<source src = "Documents/Screencast.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			</video>
			<h2> COVID Visualization Dashboard</h2>
			<p> Created a web page to display charts and data visualizations using D3 for COVID cases and deaths in four regions. The screencapture did not pick up the dropdown menus, for reference.</p>
			<video controls>
				<source src = "Documents/datavizdemo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
			</video>
			<h2> COVID World Case Tracker</h2>
			<p> Created a web page to display an interactive map and line chart
				 to display the total number of covid cases in each country. Map interactions were linked to the line chart to display only the selected countries, with continents being displayed when no selections are active.</p>
			
		</div>

		<div class = "portfolio-blurbs">
			<h1 class="portfolio-header"> Java Projects </h1>
			<h2> Integrated SQL Database Queries </h2>
			<p> Built relational tables with triggers in Oracle SQL and queried them through a Java connection.</p>
			<h2> Generative Grammar </h2>
			<p> Created a generative context-free grammar program through a file input with given rules. </p>
			<h2> Data Structures / Abstract Data Types / Sorting / Graphs</h2>
			<p> Recreated most data structures and ADTS including a binary max heap, hash table, binary search tree, graph, linked list, and priority queue. Implemented merge sort and quick sort as well as basic graph algorithms: breadth-first search, depth-first search, and topological sort.
				 This allowed me to build a strong foundation in these fundamental algorithms and data structures.</p>

		<div class = "portfolio-blurbs">
			<h1 class="portfolio-header"> Verilog Projects </h1>
			<h2> Metronome</h2>
			<p>Used the Basys 3 Board to simulate a metronome, using the buttons to change the time and lights to flash to the time.</p>
